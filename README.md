# SMCalcRevised
This is a Revised verion of my Scrap Mechanic Calculator
The main purpose of creating a new repo is so that the code doesnt get mixed up, and so I can share it with others to get help.
The main task is to better structure the code so it runs much smoother, and uses less computational power.
I intend to add a GUI with images and a system of buttons, but I want the code to work better.





I am a teenager who is trying to self teach themselves Python and C#
I have not taken ANY computer science course that involves programming other than an web design course.
